# Word Game: Things That Go Bump

**Link to live:** https://themarkfullton.github.io/Word-Guess-Game/

A spin on the classic Hangman game: You're defending a scardy cat (Shiver) from a family curse. Guess the proper name of the fear attacking Shiver and it disippates momentarily; guess it wrong and Shiver's down and out. If the fear disippates ten times, Shiver is free of the curse and can live a normal life! (That is, unless you want to play again!)

## Build Status

The build has been completed and is now in the process of undergoing crossbrowser testing.
I am also in the process of drawing pictures to fill in for the current placeholders.

## Languages Used

HTML, CSS, Vanilla Javascript

## Motivation

Completed as an assignment for UCLA Coding Bootcamp. Mixed things up quite a bit to entertain myself. Chose fears as it was easy to get a list of them and they're tricky to guess.

## Please Note

None of these images belong to me. They're currently acting as placeholders until I have the time to draw and insert in my own. (As this was a bootcamp project, it was done on a time crunch and images got the brunt of the time cut!)
